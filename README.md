# Prescription Recommendation System

## Introduction

The Prescription Recommendation System is a university project aimed at assisting healthcare providers in making personalized medication recommendations to patients based on their medical history and preferences. The system leverages various machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and suggest suitable medications.

## Algorithms Used

### 1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Singular Value Decomposition is a matrix factorization technique commonly used in collaborative filtering. In the context of the prescription recommendation system:

- **Application**: SVD is applied to the user-item interaction matrix, where users represent patients and items represent medications. By decomposing this matrix into latent factors, SVD captures underlying patterns in patient preferences and medication characteristics.
- **Purpose**: SVD helps in representing patient-medication interactions in a lower-dimensional space, facilitating personalized medication recommendations based on similarities with other patients.

### 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing techniques are used to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data, such as medical records, clinical notes, and research articles. NLP enables the system to understand and interpret patient symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment plans, thereby enhancing the accuracy of medication recommendations.

## Conclusion

The Prescription Recommendation System leverages a combination of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, machine learning models, and natural language processing techniques to provide personalized medication recommendations for patients. By harnessing the power of these algorithms, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions, improve patient outcomes, and enhance the overall quality of care.
